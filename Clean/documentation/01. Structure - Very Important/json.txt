We&#39;ve split the documentation into two separate parts, one that covers all the features of the framework, this one, and another one that covers the design elements of the item, the first docuemntation.</p>\n<p>\tSo, let&#39;s get started!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tThe documentation is structured as follows!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t<strong>1. Structure Docuemntation</strong></p>\n<p>\tThe docuemntation you are currently reading, which will show you the basic features, structure, and the most important aspects of the item</p>\n<p>\t<strong>2. Page and PageApp Docuemntation</strong></p>\n<p>\tThe documentations that show you how to use the included page templates, and how to create your own pages from the template provided.</p>\n<p>\t<strong>3. Current Template Docuemntation</strong></p>\n<p>\tThe unique features that the template you purchased has, and how to implement them in the structure. These features can range from custom headers, custom navigations and custom sliders or column structures that get added inside the template!&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-error\">\n\tIt&#39;s VERY important that you read at least the&nbsp;<strong>STRUCTURE DOCUMENTATION&nbsp;</strong>and the&nbsp;<strong>CURRENT TEMPLAETE DOCUMENTATION&nbsp;</strong>before attemting to edit the template if you do not have advnaced knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS in order to properly edit the item and not run into errors!&nbsp;</div>\n"},{"title": "Structure","id": "structure","content": "<p>\tThe structure around which the item is coded is very,&nbsp;<strong>very</strong> important. It keeps everything in place and makes sure thins work smoothly on older devices as well ( Android 4.4.2 can oficially be called an old device, iOS 6 can oficially be called an old device since these devices get new software versions every few months to a year and the old version becomes unsupported by the developers )&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tIn each of our products there will be a _starter template. That is contentless, empty template that consists of the main structure you should build upon, and makes it easier to understand rather than copy pasting a tone of code here and explaing it ( which we&#39;ll do anyway )&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<pre class=\"html\">\n&lt;body class=&quot;dual-sidebar&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- (1) --&gt; \n&lt;div id=&quot;preloader&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- (2) ---&gt;\n    &lt;div id=&quot;status&quot;&gt;\n       <span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>&lt;p class=&quot;center-text&quot;&gt;\n            Loading the content...\n            &lt;em&gt;Loading depends on your connection speed!&lt;/em&gt;\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n  \n&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-fix&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- (3) --&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;header-fixed disabled&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- (4) --&gt;   \n\n&lt;div class=&quot;all-elements&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- (5) --&gt;\n    &lt;div class=&quot;snap-drawers&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;snap-drawer snap-drawer-left&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- (6) --&gt;\n            Left Sidebar\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;snap-drawer snap-drawer-right&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- (7) --&gt;\n            Right Sidebar\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div id=&quot;content&quot; class=&quot;snap-content&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- (8) --&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;!-- CONTENT STRUCTURE CHAPTER --&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;  \n    &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; class=&quot;back-to-top-badge&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-caret-up&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Back to top&lt;/a&gt; &lt;!-- (9) --&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;!-- (10 - Remember this for later ) --&gt; \n&lt;/body&gt;</pre>\n<p>\tThe above is the main structure around which the entire item is built, now, let me explain precisely why this is needed, and how each element is used. The code is commented using &lt;!-- NUMBER --&gt; to make it easier for you to see which points we&#39;re discussing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t(1) is the main body wrapper, as any html file, but notice it has a class called&nbsp;<strong>dual-sidebar</strong>. If this class is present, the page will automatically generate the structure for the dual sidebar functionallity, meaning, you can swipe left or right on the content to enable the sidebars. You can use&nbsp;<strong>no-sidebar&nbsp;</strong>to disable all sidebars or&nbsp;<strong>left-sidebar&nbsp;</strong>to enable only the left sidebar or&nbsp;<strong>right-sidebar</strong> to enable only the right sidebar. Each page can have a different sidebar structure by simply changing the main body class code.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t(2) is the page preloader. This can be disabled if you find unnecessary or prefer oldschool pages by adding the class&nbsp;<strong>disabled</strong> to it or simply deleting lines 2 to 9. It&#39;s recommened you just add&nbsp;<strong>disabled</strong> to it.</p>\n<p>\t(3) the&nbsp;<strong>gallery-fix</strong> class is essential for every / any page that has a gallery attached to it. Certain devices run into issues with the depth of elements presented on screen and can make the image gallery click-through-able, basically meaning, you tap the image iniside the gallery, and an event is triggered under it. The <b>gallery-fix</b> class fixes that by creating a dummy full screen transparent layer that protects you from clicking under the gallery. Too much technical terms? Just leave the gallery-fix class at the top of the page, and our code will take care of the rest!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t(4) With this new framework, we&#39;ve finally found a solution to enable a fixed header, while at the same time keeping swiping sidebars and scrolling the page while the header is fixed. However, in order for this to work, your header must be placed at the top of the page, where it is shown in the example code above. We&#39;ve set it to&nbsp;<strong>disabled</strong> in the code since we&#39;re just explaing how it works! In a real template, it won&#39;t have the disabled class, and it will have content inside it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t(5) The&nbsp;<strong>all-elements</strong> class has a vital role in the functionallity of the page. It keeps the scrollbars from showing when you open the sidebars, and it&#39;s also the main housing class for all the content of the page / framework that we used!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t(6) - (7) Are the classes the house the sidebars. Each of them will be enabled or disabled by using what&#39;s explained in (1)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t(8) Is the <b>content ID</b>, attention,&nbsp;<strong>ID, not Class</strong>. This is unique, per page. And this is the trigger of the sidebar. This listens for swiping gestures and houses everything the framework has to offer. We&#39;ll explain more in the next chapter,&nbsp;<strong>Content Structure</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t(9) The back to top badge, is the blue element that shows up when you scroll passed the header and almost get to the bottom of the page. This acts like a native app button, and well, has the purpose of jumping you back up!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n"},{"title": "Content Structure","id": "content_structure","content": "<p>\tThe contet structure is pretty super simple! And this is mostly the last part where there&#39;s a tone to read! After this, we can start talking features!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tIn the structure chapter, there is a code comment&nbsp;<strong><span style=\"line-height: 19px;\">&lt;!-- CONTENT STRUCTURE CHAPTER --&gt;&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"line-height: 19px;\">and where that comment is placed, you can add everything from this point forward except if specifically mentioned not to.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h4>\n\t<strong>The Main Content Class:</strong></h4>\n<pre class=\"html\">\n&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>\tThis class sets the left and right padding of the page using javascript, to be 30 pixels on mobiles and 50 pixels on tablets. It&#39;s esential to have to keep your page not glued to the sides of the device.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>\n\t<strong>Boxed Container Class</strong></h4>\n<pre class=\"html\">\n&lt;div class=&quot;container OPTIONAL_VALUES&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>\tThe container class can be used to add columns, text, headings and everything else you want to use, and it helps keep things neetly organized into blocks. The container class is vital for things like toggles and each one needs to be added in a sperate container, but other than that, the <b>container&nbsp;</b>classes main purpose is to add a bottom margin for a better visual hierarchy</p>\n<p>\t<strong>Optional Values: no-bottom, half-bottom, full-bottom</strong></p>\n<p>\tUsing <strong>no-bottom</strong>, will leave the container with no margin bottom to it,&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tUsing <strong>half-bottom</strong>, will leave the contaner with only half the bottom of it&#39;s original full value</p>\n<p>\tUsing <strong>full-bottom </strong>is unnecessary for containers, since the default of a container is full-bottom ( 30 pixels )&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tThese optional values can be added to absolutely every element in the template, from paragraphs to heading to fields to boxes.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>\n\t<b>Unboxed Container | Full Width Container Class</b></h4>\n<pre class=\"html\">\n&lt;div class=&quot;container-fullscreen OPTIONAL_VALUES&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>\tThe above creates a container that is full width, ignoring it&#39;s parrents left and right margin. this can be used for things like headings or elements that you want to stretch the full width of the screen without having to close and re-open the main content class. The optional values applicable here are the ones in the container but also, a few others specific to elements such as headings, which are described in the typography chapter.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n"},{"title": "Column Structure","id": "column_structure","content": "<p>\tCreating columns is beyond simple.

That will result in having a full bottom added by default from both elements. To counter this, you can add no-bottom to any of the elements to keep one of them from applying the bottom. An instant example would be if you have a parahraph inside a container. You can add the class no-bottom either to the parahraph or the container and only one of them will add the bottom margin.</p>\n<h4>\n\tBackground Colors</h4>\n<p>\tSome elements such as highlighted text, headings or notifications and many others, have a background color secondary class added to them that represents the background-color of that element.

To activate a toggle use the secondary class&nbsp;<strong>active-toggle&nbsp;</strong>and also, the main anchor houses an icon, this icon must have the secondary class&nbsp;<strong>rotate-toggle.</strong> The&nbsp;<strong>active-toggle</strong> shows the content while the&nbsp;<strong>rotate-toggle</strong> changes the plus sign at the right to a red x sign.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>\n\tAccordions</h4>\n<pre class=\"html\">\n&lt;div class=&quot;accordion&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;h6 class=&quot;accordion-toggle&quot;&gt;\n        Accordion 1\n        &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-angle-down rotate-180&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n    &lt;/h6&gt;\n    &lt;div class=&quot;accordion-content active-accordion&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;h6 class=&quot;accordion-toggle&quot;&gt;\n        Accordion 2\n        &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-angle-down&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n    &lt;/h6&gt;\n    &lt;div class=&quot;accordion-content&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>\tThe accordion targets the child above it to make it active, on tap. To create an accordion, you need a class the <strong>accordion-toggle </strong>with the title and the icon, and the <strong>accordion-content</strong> where the content will be shown! Once an accordion is clicked it cannot be unclicked. To make an accordion active by default, give the accordion-content the secondary class <b>active-accordion&nbsp;</b>and you must give the icon the secondary class&nbsp;<strong>rotate-180</strong></p>\n<h4 style=\"margin: 18px 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-family: Arial, verdana, arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.5em; color: rgb(56, 56, 56);\">\n\tTabs</h4>\n<pre class=\"html\">\n&lt;ul class=&quot;tabs&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;li class=&quot;tab-link active-tab&quot; data-tab=&quot;tab-1&quot;&gt;Tab 1&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li class=&quot;tab-link&quot; data-tab=&quot;tab-2&quot;&gt;Tab 2&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div id=&quot;tab-1&quot; class=&quot;tab-content active-tab-content&quot;&gt;\n    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div id=&quot;tab-2&quot; class=&quot;tab-content&quot;&gt;\n     Duis aute irure dolor in \n&lt;/div&gt;\n</pre>\n<p>\tTabs are based on a very easy and simple to follow structure, but the entire structure above must be placed within a&nbsp;<strong>container&nbsp;</strong>to make sure the JS can target the tabs properly. You can use as many tabs as you want but we recommned using tops 4 considering the smallest scree (5s / 5, S3 / S4 ) have resolutions of 320 pixels. To create a new tab you need to add duplicate the list on line 3 and give it the <b>data-tab=&quot;tab-NUMBER&quot;&nbsp;</b>and also, give the same&nbsp;<strong>tab-NUMBER</strong> value to a div and the class&nbsp;<strong>tab-content</strong>.

Not really hard!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\tThe main class&nbsp;<strong>static-notification</strong> is combined with a secondary class that adjusts the background. You can find more about these in the <b>Secondary Classes&nbsp;</b>Chapter</p>\n<p>\t<b>TIP:</b> If you don&#39;t want to have an icon for the notification, give it the&nbsp;<strong>Secondary Class</strong>&nbsp;<strong>disabled</strong>. Deleting it completly may cause issues since they are targeted using CSS.</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>\n\t<strong>Small Notifications</strong></h4>\n<pre class=\"html\">\n&lt;div class=&quot;static-notification bg-red-dark tap-dismiss&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;\n        &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-times&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n        This is a warning notification\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt; </pre>\n<p>\tSmall notifications unlike their bigger brothers have no closing icon and no paragraph, yet the same principle applies. They include the same background color changes that can be found in the&nbsp;<strong>Secondary Class Chapter&nbsp;</strong>and have an aditional class that allows hiding them. If you add the secondary class&nbsp;<strong>tap-dismiss</strong> to your notifications, clicking them will result in them hiding.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>\n\t<strong>Fixed Top and Bottom Notifications</strong></h4>\n<p>\tThese notifications, require some changes in the JS, but don&#39;t worry. we&#39;ll walk you through them. Also, changes to the entire structure of the page must be applied, so please, read carefuly!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\t<strong>The trigger</strong> of a fixed bottom or fixed top notification is simply a link / anchor, which you can place whever you want for a user to tap and activate this&nbsp;</p>\n<pre class=\"html\">\n&lt;a class=&quot;show-top-notification-1&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Fixed Top Notification&lt;/a&gt;   </pre>\n<p>\tBut, if you looked at the <b>Structure Chapter</b> we added a number (10) there saying remember this.
